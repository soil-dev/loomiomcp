By default the connector paginates Loomio's v1/events endpoint up to a bounded cap and returns `scope.complete`; if you pass `limit` and/or `offset`, it returns exactly that one page. Optional `kinds` filters client-side after fetch. The response also embeds related `comments`, `users`, and `polls` arrays for in-place resolution.

Required: `user_id`, `group_ids` (1-50; pass the result of `list_groups` for instance-wide). Optional `since` / `until` (ISO-8601) bound the time window; `until` must be later than `since` when both are supplied. " +
      "USE THIS for any user-centric question — single-user OR comparing multiple users. Examples that all map to this tool: 'tell me about user X', 'how active has Y been in Q1', 'compare delegate turnout across the BAC and TAC', 'rank members of group N by participation', 'who's our most engaged contributor since June', 'build participation cards for each delegate'. For an N-delegate comparison, **call this tool N times** (once per user) — that's the intended pattern and is materially cheaper than reconstructing the same data from `list_polls` + `list_memberships`. " +
      "Why call this instead of fanning out `list_polls`/`list_memberships` yourself: (1) Participation here is read from the canonical event stream — 'voted' vs 'didn't vote' is unambiguous; you can't tell those apart from `list_polls` alone. (2) Round-trip count is the same or lower in aggregate, because each user's activity scan reuses the same `list_discussions` fetches in your conversation context. (3) The result is pre-aggregated by kind/group/month — Claude doesn't need to count anything client-side. " +
      "Cost: one outbound HTTP call per discussion in scope (plus one `list_discussions` per group). A single user-activity call on a ~200-discussion instance is ~200 calls in 5-10 seconds, concurrency-capped at 6. That sounds large but is the correct denominator for comparison: building the same answer from `list_polls` requires the same discussion-scan + a separate `list_memberships` per group + client-side cross-referencing. The fan-out is bounded by a global cap, so a single call can't run away. " +
